# Cython
This project provides some Cython tools for finance-quant. 

## Python-quant
When we oberserve the market situation or develop the strategyï¼Œ it's often necessary to calculate the correlation of time series. Python provides numpy library to do some basic calculation. However, if we have some customized needs, python is often too slow to satisfy our request. In that case, we can use cython. Cython acts as a connector to call c++ for high computational speed and wrap c++ as a pythonic function!
